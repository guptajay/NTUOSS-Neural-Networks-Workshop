Welcome to the final TGIFHacks workshop for Semester 1 AY 20/21. This workshop will give you a brief introduction to Machine Learning and Neural Networks. You will learn the fundamentals behind artifical neural networks and how they help machines to make decisions on their own.

After than, in a hands-on exercise, you will be introduced to Keras, one of the leading Deep Learning frameworks out there. This will open up countless posibilities for you to build exciting and amazing machine learning applications. As part of the workshop, you will learn to train a neural network to identify different types of flowers only with a few given attributes. So let's get started!

## Workshop Details:
**Time**: Friday, 30 October 2020. 6:30pm - 8:30pm  
**Location**: Microsoft Teams (due to COVID-19 measures)
